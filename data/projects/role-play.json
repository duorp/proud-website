  "description": "Through interviewing subcultures, organizations, and individuals who engage in the activity of roleplaying, ROLE / PLAY magazine breaks down the significance of ROLE in relation to identity, community, and belonging; and PLAY, in relation to imagination, escapism, and speculation. Our first issue puts us in conversation with amateur LARPer and DnD enthusiast Claire Schuler, as we discuss creating and embodying characters, to what it means to facilitate human interactions in imaginary worlds.",
